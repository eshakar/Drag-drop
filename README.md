#Drag-and-Drop Website Builder Prototype
Objective
Transform Websites.co.in's form-based website builder into an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to drag elements (text, images, buttons) into a predefined template structure (header, body, footer) and configure element properties via forms, enhancing design control while preserving the existing form-based approach.
Architecture

Sidebar: A toolbox containing draggable elements (text, image, button) implemented with react-dnd for smooth drag-and-drop interactions. Styled with shadcn/ui Card and Button components for a polished look.
Canvas: Renders a predefined template with three sections (header, body, footer), each acting as a separate drop zone using react-dnd. Elements are stored in Redux, with visual feedback (e.g., green background on drag-over) for better UX. Includes undo/redo buttons using shadcn/ui Button.
PropertiesPanel: A form-based editor for customizing element properties (e.g., text content, font size, color, image URL) using shadcn/ui components (Input, Label, Select, Card). Updates are managed via Redux for real-time rendering.
State Management: Redux Toolkit (canvasSlice.js) manages elements, their properties, and state history for undo/redo functionality. Elements are associated with section IDs to support the template structure.
Styling: Tailwind CSS provides responsive, utility-first styling. shadcn/ui components integrate with Tailwind for a modern, accessible UI.

Tools Used

Vite: Fast build tool for efficient development and production builds.
React: Component-based framework for building the UI (preferred by the problem statement).
Redux Toolkit: Centralized state management for elements, properties, and history (undo/redo).
react-dnd + HTML5 Backend: Enables smooth drag-and-drop functionality with section-based drop zones.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and maintainable styling.
shadcn/ui: Reusable, accessible UI components (Button, Input, Card, Label, Select) styled with Tailwind.
tailwind-merge: Merges Tailwind classes to avoid conflicts in the cn utility.

Rationale

react-dnd: Chosen for its flexibility in implementing drag-and-drop with multiple drop zones (header, body, footer), supporting precise element placement and future grid-based positioning.
Redux Toolkit: Provides scalable state management for elements, properties, and history, enabling features like undo/redo and template support.
Tailwind CSS: Ensures rapid development of responsive layouts (e.g., flex-col md:flex-row for mobile support) with minimal custom CSS.
shadcn/ui: Delivers polished, accessible UI components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind, enhancing user experience and form-based customization.
Form-Based Approach: Preserves Websites.co.in's existing form-driven workflow, augmented with drag-and-drop for greater design flexibility.

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>
cd drag-drop-builder


Install dependencies:npm install


Run the development server:npm run dev


Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the prototype.

Usage

Drag-and-Drop: Drag elements (text, image, button) from the sidebar to a template section (header, body, or footer) on the canvas.
Customize: Click an element to open the properties panel. Edit properties like text content, font size (via dropdown), colors (via color picker), or image URL/width using forms.
Undo/Redo: Use the undo/redo buttons on the canvas to revert or restore changes.
Responsive Design: The layout stacks vertically on mobile devices (below 768px) and displays horizontally on desktop, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

Future Enhancements

Grid System: Integrate react-grid-layout for precise element positioning within sections, enabling more complex layouts.
Dynamic Templates: Allow users to select or create custom template structures (e.g., add/remove sections).
Additional Properties: Support more styling options (e.g., padding, margin, alignment) in the properties panel.
Export Functionality: Save the canvas state as JSON for website generation or export to Websites.co.inâ€™s backend.
Form Validation: Add validation for inputs (e.g., valid image URLs) to prevent errors.
New Elements: Extend support for additional element types (e.g., video, forms) via elementTypes and Element.jsx.

Known Limitations

Template is fixed to three sections (header, body, footer); dynamic templates are not yet supported.
Limited element properties (e.g., font size, color, width); could include more styling options.
Undo/redo history is basic and does not persist across sessions.
Mobile usability is functional but could be enhanced with collapsible panels or touch-friendly controls.
